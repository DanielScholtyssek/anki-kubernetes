**Question:** In which order does the kube-apiserver process an incoming request?
**Options:** A. TLS terminates, then Authentication, Authorization, Admission Control, persist to etcd<br>B. Authentication, Authorization, Admission Control, then TLS terminates<br>C. Authorization, Authentication, Admission Control, persist to etcd<br>D. Authentication, Admission Control, Authorization, persist to etcd
**Answer:** A – TLS terminates first, then Authentication, Authorization, Admission Control, then the object persists to etcd
**Explanation:** Every API request passes the same pipeline: transport security (TLS cert check) → Authentication (WHO are you — cert/token/service account) → Authorization (WHAT may you do — RBAC/ABAC/Node/Webhook) → Admission Control (mutate or reject writes, e.g. LimitRange injecting defaults, PSA). Note that admission only acts on create/update/delete/connect requests — pure reads skip it — and the object is only written to etcd after surviving all stages.

**Question:** Which mechanisms can authenticate a caller to the kube-apiserver? (Select all that apply)
**Options:** A. X.509 client certificates signed by the cluster CA<br>B. ServiceAccount tokens (JWTs)<br>C. Static token or password file<br>D. External identity providers (OIDC, webhook, LDAP)<br>E. SSH keys
**Answer:** A, B, C, D – client certs, ServiceAccount tokens, static token/password file, and external providers (OIDC/webhook/LDAP)
**Explanation:** Authentication answers WHO can access the cluster. The API server supports client certificates signed by the cluster CA, bearer tokens (static token file, bootstrap tokens, ServiceAccount JWTs), basic password auth via a static file, and external providers (OIDC, authentication webhook — which bridges LDAP/other IdPs). Multiple modules can be configured and are tried in sequence until one succeeds. SSH keys secure access to the HOSTS, not the Kubernetes API.

**Question:** Which authorization modes can the kube-apiserver enforce? (Select all that apply)
**Options:** A. RBAC — roles bound to users/groups/service accounts<br>B. ABAC — attribute-based access control policies<br>C. Node authorization — constrains kubelets to their own node's objects<br>D. Webhook — delegates the decision to an external service<br>E. OAuth — OAuth2 access tokens
**Answer:** A, B, C, D – RBAC, ABAC, Node authorization, and Webhook mode
**Explanation:** Authorization answers WHAT an authenticated caller may do. The API server can run multiple authorization modules: RBAC (role-based, the common one — Roles/ClusterRoles + bindings), ABAC (attribute-based policies on user/verb/resource), Node authorization (special mode that constrains what kubelets may read/write to the objects their node needs), and Webhook (delegates the decision to an external service). If several modules are configured, each is checked — the request proceeds if ANY module authorizes it.

**Question:** Which statement about encryption between Kubernetes components is TRUE?
**Options:** A. All control-plane traffic is TLS-encrypted: kubectl→apiserver, apiserver↔etcd, and apiserver to kubelets/other components<br>B. Only kubectl→apiserver is encrypted; inter-component traffic is plain HTTP<br>C. TLS is an optional add-on installed by the CNI plugin<br>D. Components authenticate each other with bearer tokens, so TLS is unnecessary
**Answer:** A – all control-plane component traffic plus client traffic to the apiserver is TLS-encrypted
**Explanation:** TLS secures the entire control plane: kubectl/clients to kube-apiserver, apiserver to etcd, and apiserver's calls to kubelets, kube-proxy and the other components are all encrypted in transit (with a cluster CA — typically etcd, /etc/kubernetes/pki, issued by kubeadm or your own PKI). Plaintext is not a supported posture for API traffic; the 'insecure port' was removed entirely in Kubernetes 1.20.

**Question:** Before applying Kubernetes-level security controls, what should be hardened first?
**Options:** A. The underlying hosts — SSH key-only auth, no password logins, patched OS<br>B. The pod manifests — set a securityContext first<br>C. The CNI plugin — enable its security features first<br>D. The container registry — sign all images first
**Answer:** A – harden the underlying hosts first: SSH key-only login, no password auth, patched OS
**Explanation:** Defense starts below Kubernetes: the cluster lives on its nodes, and a rooted node means a rooted cluster. Baseline host hardening — SSH key-only access, password auth disabled, OS patched, no unneeded services/ports — comes before any Kubernetes-level control. Only after the hosts are secured does the k8s-specific layering matter: API access control, RBAC, NetworkPolicies, pod security.

**Front:** By default, how much pod-to-pod traffic does Kubernetes allow, and what restricts it?
**Back:** Open — the pod network is flat: every pod can reach every other pod and namespace by default (no built-in isolation). NetworkPolicy is the opt-in control: a policy selects pods (podSelector) and whitelists ingress/egress; once a pod is selected by any policy, only matching traffic is allowed. Policies are enforced by the CNI plugin — a CNI that doesn't support NetworkPolicies silently ignores them.

**Question:** In X.509 client-certificate authentication, how does Kubernetes map a certificate's subject to a user identity?
**Options:** A. The Issuer field becomes the username<br>B. CN maps to the username; O entries map to groups<br>C. The certificate serial number becomes the UID<br>D. Validity dates decide the session timeout
**Answer:** B – the Common Name (CN) maps to the username and Organization (O) entries map to groups
**Explanation:** Certificate attributes become identity: CN → username, each O → a group (order doesn't matter). So a cert with subject '/CN=alice/O=devs/O=ops' authenticates as user 'alice' in groups 'devs'+'ops' — plus everyone authentic'd also joins 'system:authenticated'. Signed by the cluster's client CA, the identity is then passed to authorization (RBAC) for permission checks.

**Question:** How does the static token file authentication method work?
**Options:** A. A ConfigMap listing users and passwords<br>B. A Secret of type kubernetes.io/service-account-token<br>C. CSV rows of 'token,user,uid,"groups"' served by --token-auth-file<br>D. A users.yaml inside /etc/kubernetes/manifests
**Answer:** C – CSV rows of 'token,user,uid,"group1,group2"' served by the apiserver flag --token-auth-file
**Explanation:** The static token file is a CSV on the control-plane node passed via '--token-auth-file=/path/file.csv'; each row is token,user,uid,"groups". Callers present the token as 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'. It's simple but static — changing users means editing the file and restarting kube-apiserver, and tokens are plaintext on disk, so it's discouraged for production.

**Question:** What happens to an API request that presents NO credentials at all?
**Options:** A. They are rejected with 403 Forbidden<br>B. They map to system:anonymous in group system:unauthenticated (if anonymous auth is on)<br>C. They get read-only guest permissions<br>D. They retry after a backoff
**Answer:** B – unauthenticated calls map to system:anonymous / system:unauthenticated (401 if disabled)
**Explanation:** Requests that pass no credentials don't automatically get rejected: if anonymous auth is enabled they become 'system:anonymous' in group 'system:unauthenticated' and RBAC decides if that identity may act (usually it can't). Disable with '--anonymous-auth=false' on kube-apiserver. Every request is thus either an authenticated identity (users get 'system:authenticated' added) or the anonymous identity.

**Question:** How can external identity systems like LDAP or Kerberos authenticate Kubernetes users? (Select all that apply)
**Options:** A. LDAP via a built-in --ldap-server flag<br>B. An authenticating proxy that forwards identity headers<br>C. An authentication webhook (TokenReview API)<br>D. Kerberos tickets passed directly to the apiserver
**Answer:** B, C – authenticating proxy or authentication webhook; native OIDC is the built-in IdP path
**Explanation:** There is no native LDAP/Kerberos/SAML plugin: Kubernetes natively supports client certs, bearer tokens (incl. ServiceAccount JWTs), and OIDC. To reach LDAP/Kerberos/etc. you front the API with an authenticating proxy that maps headers to user identity, or use an authentication webhook — the apiserver calls your token-review service which returns the user info. OIDC (e.g. Dex/Keycloak/Entra) is the one external-identity mechanism the API server supports natively.

**Question:** After 'kubectl create serviceaccount jenkins', what username does the API server assign that identity?
**Options:** A. system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:jenkins<br>B. jenkins@<namespace>.svc<br>C. system:user:jenkins<br>D. user:jenkins:service
**Answer:** A – kubectl create serviceaccount jenkins produces identity 'system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:jenkins'
**Explanation:** ServiceAccounts ARE API objects — namespaced and creatable via kubectl or YAML (unlike normal users). Pods mount the SA's token, and in-cluster processes authenticate as 'system:serviceaccount:<ns>:<name>' in groups 'system:serviceaccounts' and 'system:serviceaccounts:<ns>'; the signed JWT also works for clients outside the cluster. Because SA tokens can be stored in Secrets, be careful who can read them.

**Front:** Users vs ServiceAccounts in Kubernetes — which ones can you 'kubectl create'?
**Back:** Only ServiceAccounts — they ARE API objects (namespaced, kubectl-creatable). Normal users are NOT Kubernetes objects at all: 'Kubernetes does not have objects which represent normal user accounts.' Humans/automation get identity from an external source — a client cert signed by the cluster CA, an OIDC/IdP login, a static token file — and the apiserver just validates it. Rule of thumb: humans = external user identity; in-cluster processes = ServiceAccount.

**Domain:** TLS Certificates
**Question:** What is a Certificate Authority (CA) and what does it do?
**Options:** A. A service that stores certificates for retrieval<br>B. The trusted issuer that signs certificates; everything trusts certs signed by it<br>C. A load balancer that terminates TLS<br>D. An etcd key that encrypts secrets
**Answer:** B – the trusted issuer that signs certificates; everything trusts certs signed by it
**Explanation:** A CA is the root of trust: it holds a key pair (ca.key private + ca.crt public cert). It validates CSRs and signs them with ca.key — the signature is what makes a certificate trustworthy. Every client/server carries a copy of ca.crt and accepts any cert signed by that CA. In a cluster the CA is how all components verify each other's identity; keep ca.key private on the signing host — whoever has it can mint identities.

**Question:** To mint a cluster-admin user cert for kubectl access, what must the certificate subject contain?
**Options:** A. CN=system:masters<br>B. O=system:masters — the O field carries the group<br>C. OU=admin plus CN=system:masters<br>D. A special flag in the CSR's extensions
**Answer:** B – the O (Organization) field carries group membership; O=system:masters grants cluster-admin
**Explanation:** Groups come from the cert's O field — 'openssl req -subj "/CN=kube-admin/O=system:masters"' makes an identity that authenticates as user 'kube-admin' in group 'system:masters'. system:masters is bound to the cluster-admin ClusterRole out of the box, which is what actually grants full control — the cert just proves membership.

**Question:** Which identity mappings do Kubernetes component certificates require? (Select all that apply)
**Options:** A. kube-proxy cert must carry CN=system:kube-proxy<br>B. Each kubelet cert must carry CN=system:node:<nodename> with O=system:nodes<br>C. Admin users need O=system:masters in their cert<br>D. Any CN works — RBAC ignores certificate subjects
**Answer:** A, B, C – system:kube-proxy for kube-proxy, system:node:<nodename>+O=system:nodes for each kubelet, O=system:masters for admin users
**Explanation:** Component identities are fixed names the control plane expects: kube-proxy authenticates as 'system:kube-proxy' (CN), each kubelet as 'system:node:<nodeName>' (CN) plus group 'system:nodes' (O) — Node authorizer relies on that mapping; an admin user is 'kube-admin' (or any CN) in group 'system:masters'.

**Question:** Why does the kube-apiserver certificate need an openssl.cnf with an [alt_names] section?
**Options:** A. openssl.cnf encrypts the private key<br>B. alt_names lists every DNS name and IP clients use to reach the apiserver — required or hostname verification fails<br>C. It's only needed to set the certificate expiry date<br>D. SANs are for encrypting etcd at rest
**Answer:** B – SANs let one cert be valid for every name/IP clients dial the apiserver by (kubernetes, .svc FQDNs, internal + external IPs)
**Explanation:** The apiserver is reachable under several names: the 'kubernetes' Service name (kubernetes, kubernetes.default, kubernetes.default.svc, kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local), plus node/public IPs. TLS hostname verification fails if the dialed name isn't in the cert — so the openssl.cnf used to generate the apiserver cert carries an [alt_names] section listing every DNS name and IP (internal + external) that will reach it.

**Question:** How is TLS handled between etcd cluster members?
**Options:** A. etcd doesn't support TLS — it relies on NetworkPolicies<br>B. Peer certs authenticate etcd members to each other; client certs authenticate the apiserver — both set via etcd config flags<br>C. etcd certs are stored as Kubernetes Secrets and mounted at runtime<br>D. Peer certs are only for etcd backups
**Answer:** B – etcd members authenticate each other with peer certificates; apiserver↔etcd uses client certs, all configured via etcd flags
**Explanation:** etcd runs its own PKI within the cluster's: member-to-member (peer) traffic uses --peer-cert-file/--peer-key-file/--peer-trusted-ca-file, and clients (kube-apiserver) use --cert-file/--key-file/--trusted-ca-file. These paths are set in the etcd static pod manifest (/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml on kubeadm) — usually under /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/.

**Question:** Who needs the CA certificate, and who needs the CA private key?
**Options:** A. Distribute ca.crt to every component for verification; keep ca.key private on the signing host<br>B. Distribute ca.key so components can verify certs<br>C. Copy both key and cert everywhere — they're a pair<br>D. Neither — verification uses the etcd root
**Answer:** A – everyone gets a COPY of the CA certificate to verify peers; ca.key never leaves the signing host
**Explanation:** Verification is asymmetric: to trust a peer's certificate you only need the CA's public cert — so ca.crt is distributed to every node, component config, and kubeconfig (certificate-authority field). The ca.key is what mints identities, so it stays private on the control-plane/signing host: whoever holds it can forge any identity in the cluster.

**Options:** A. A certificate backup for disaster recovery<br>B. An unsigned request containing the public key + subject details the CA signs into a certificate<br>C. A certificate that failed hostname verification<br>D. The CA's own self-signed root
**Answer:** B – an unsigned request: public key + subject details (CN, O, SANs) packaged for the CA to sign into a certificate
**Explanation:** A CSR is your key pair's PUBLIC half plus identity details (CN username, O groups, SANs) wrapped into a signing request — a certificate-to-be minus the signature. You hand it to a CA (openssl req -new -key x.key -out x.csr), it verifies and stamps 'signed by me' (openssl x509 -req -in x.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -out x.crt).

**Answer:** B – a per-node client cert with CN=system:node:<nodeName> and O=system:nodes, unique to that machine
**Explanation:** Every kubelet talks to the apiserver as its OWN node identity: the client cert's CN must be 'system:node:<nodeName>' and O=system:nodes — one cert per node, minted with that node's name. kubeadm keeps it under /var/lib/kubelet/pki/ and references it in kubelet.conf; with TLS bootstrap the kubelet even requests the cert itself via the certificates.k8s.io CSR API using a bootstrap token.

**Answer:** B – Node authorization uses the cert's system:node:<name> to restrict each kubelet to objects belonging to its own node
**Explanation:** The Node authorizer + NodeRestriction admission gate kubelet requests against the node name baked into its cert: 'system:node:worker-2' may only read pods scheduled to worker-2 and update its own node/secrets — it cannot list other nodes' pods or secrets. The name match is why node certs are per-node: a stolen kubelet cert only grants that one node's reach.
